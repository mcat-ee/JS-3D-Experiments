# Navmesh Navigation

This project contains a simple JS implementation of navigation meshes.
Navigation meshes are used for pathfinding and provide a more fluid result than simply using waypoints (as this can lead to bottlenecks and very robot-like agent behaviour).

This project will be extended to include support for:
-agents (controlled by both the user and a simple AI)
-user input
-dynamic object placement within navigation meshes


Please do not use this code; it is in dire need of cleanup/refactoring.
